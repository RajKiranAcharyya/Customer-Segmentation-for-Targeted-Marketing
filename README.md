# Customer-Segmentation-for-Targeted-Marketing
Segmented customers using K-Means Clustering on purchasing behavior and demographics (spending, frequency, recency). The project involved data cleaning, feature scaling, clustering, and visualization to identify customer segments for personalized marketing strategies. Technologies used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Technologies Used
- Programming: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Dataset: Provided in customer_data.csv

## Project Files
1. customer_data.csv: Input dataset with customer details.
2. data_cleaning.py: Preprocesses and scales the data.
3. clustering.py: Applies K-Means Clustering and assigns clusters.
4. visualization.py: Visualizes the clustered data and customer segments.

## Steps to Run
1. Place customer_data.csv in the working directory.
2. Run data_cleaning.py to preprocess the dataset.
3. Execute clustering.py to perform K-Means clustering.
4. Use visualization.py to generate scatter plots and cluster distribution graphs.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and scales features.
- Clustering: Groups customers using K-Means.
- Visualization: Displays clusters and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Outcome
This project provides actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies by identifying customer segments based on behavioral patterns.
